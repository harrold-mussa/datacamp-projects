    "London, or as the Romans called it \"Londonium\"! Home to [over 8.5 million residents](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/populationandhouseholdestimatesenglandandwales/census2021unroundeddata#population-and-household-estimates-england-and-wales-data) who speak over [300 languages](https://web.archive.org/web/20080924084621/http://www.cilt.org.uk/faqs/langspoken.htm). While the City of London is a little over one square mile (hence its nickname \"The Square Mile\"), Greater London has grown to encompass 32 boroughs spanning a total area of 606 square miles! \n",

    "Given the city's roads were originally designed for horse and cart, this area and population growth has required the development of an efficient public transport system! Since the year 2000, this has been through the local government body called **Transport for London**, or *TfL*, which is managed by the London Mayor's office. Their remit covers the London Underground, Overground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), buses, trams, river services (clipper and [Emirates Airline cable car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_cable_car)), roads, and even taxis.\n",

    "The data has been loaded into a **Snowflake** database called `TFL` with a single table called `JOURNEYS`, including the following data:\n",
